Coursework for SNHU CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    In the course we were solving the problem of how to store, sort, and access large amounts of data using the most effiecent means available. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  We approached this proble by learning to understand that different types of data are better stored and accessed using specific data structures. 
  The choice of the proper struct depends on the data you are working with and there is no one size fits all solution when it comes to using the 
  needed struct. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    Any roadblocks were quickly over came using online coding resources such as W3 schools or Geeks For Geeks, also having the textbook from the 
    previous C++ course helped tremendously. 
    
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? 
    The work done here gave me a better understanding of how small algorithms have a large impact on every aspect of society. As a note it would seem 
    that recursion is more important than what you give your instructors credit for.
    
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
    There was not much of a shift in this area as I have had extensive practice in choosing the appropriate varible, method, function, or class name. 
    Keeping the code adaptable is rather simple when using OOP; so long as you remember that what something is as opposed to what something does are 
    two distinct descriptions of the same object. 
    From here properly commenting the code is a must as I myself despise going behind someone and having a WTH! moment!
